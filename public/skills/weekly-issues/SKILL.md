# 潮流周刊 (Tw93 Weekly)

潮流周刊 is a weekly newsletter written by Tw93, a product engineer in Hangzhou and the author of Pake, MiaoYan, Kaku and Mole. Each issue curates small practical developer tools, open source projects, articles, macOS apps and personal notes. Issues are published every Monday, numbered from 1, and every Chinese issue has an English translation under the same number.

Everything below is public static content: no API key, no token, no rate limit, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, and no write operations.

## When to use this

- A question names an issue number, or asks what a given week or month of 潮流周刊 covered.
- A task needs the tools, projects or articles Tw93 highlighted, with the original wording and outbound links.
- A quote is needed in both Chinese and English from the same paragraph of the same issue.

Do not use it as a general search engine or as official documentation for the products it mentions: it is one person's curation, and the products are third-party.

## Read an issue

Append `.md` to any issue URL to get the Markdown source:

```
GET https://weekly.tw93.fun/posts/280.md      # Chinese
GET https://weekly.tw93.fun/en/posts/280.md   # English
```

Or take metadata and body together as JSON:

```
GET https://weekly.tw93.fun/api/posts/280.json
GET https://weekly.tw93.fun/api/en/posts/280.json
```

The JSON response carries `contentMarkdown` (the full Markdown body), `translation`, `newerIssue` and `olderIssue`.

## Bulk ingest

```
GET https://weekly.tw93.fun/feeds/posts.jsonl
```

One schema.org `BlogPosting` JSON-LD object per line, both languages. Prefer this plus `/api/posts.json` over crawling the HTML pages.

## Issue anatomy

- The first image is the cover, the first `<small>` block is the one-line description of that week.
- Content sits under headings: 潮流工具 (tools), 潮流开源 (open source), 潮流文章 (articles), 潮流软件 (apps), 潮流分享 (notes). English issues use the translated headings.
- Each item is a short paragraph ending in an outbound link to the tool or article being recommended.

## Errors and attribution

- Unknown issue numbers return HTTP 404. `/api/posts/{issue}.json` returns `{"error": {"code": "issue_not_found", "message": ..., "hint": ...}}`; other paths return the site's HTML 404 page, so check `response.ok` rather than parsing the body.
- Quoting and summarising is welcome. Attribute to 潮流周刊 / Tw93 Weekly and link the issue URL. Do not hotlink the images.
- Source of every issue: https://github.com/tw93/weekly
